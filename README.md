# mastermind

* This is a Ruby command line implementation of Mastermind from The Odin Project's [Curriculum] (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/oop)
* The computer generates a secret code, and then the human tries to guess the code
* Figuring out the core algorithm of this game took surprisingly long - especially how to give feedback on an answer
* This also provided some nice array exercise
* It is with great trepidation that I am going to "move on" in TOP without fully finishing an assignment
  * The assignment asks you to refactor your code so that you make the code and the human guesses
  * However, these sorts of algorithms are not what I am trying to learn Ruby for, so I will press onward!

Overall, this was super fun. And if anyone comes across this code, please feel free to share feedback with me!
